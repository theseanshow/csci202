        <p>This self-portrait reflects my frequent habits, both online and offline. I am a graphic design major, so drawing is especially important to me. The thought behind the entire self-portrait was to incorporate some drawing of a face in css, and each of those elements are clickable to click on a drawing. However, I realized halfway through that I couldn’t get the fact as perfect as I wished, so unfortunately, I had to settle on simple shapes that looked somewhat of a face. 
            <br>My earliest memory surfing the internet was probably when I was 7 or 8. Of course, before that I didn’t have access to the internet due to varying circumstances, such as a lot of childhood moving and poverty, but when I got access to a computer, I remember going wild with it. I played a lot of Club Penguin and Poptoprica around that age, and it was super fun! There were instances where I would look up “club penguin coin hacks”, and I would accidentally click on some shady links that would infect my family’s brand-new computer with viruses. Over the years, I learned how to be more cautious on the internet, and I picked up new gaming habits, such as Roblox in 2009, Cool Math Games throughout elementary school, and other misc games found on Newgrounds. I remember seeing kids with iPods around elementary school, and I wanted one so badly! However, I didn’t get a phone until middle school, and it was my brother’s old HTC Hero. This changed how I explored the internet! I would now read fanfictions, write some Minecraft fanfictions in 6th and 7th grade. I now wouldn’t click any shady links, but my parents insisted that whenever they would install viruses, they would say it was me. Over the years, I got various laptops, phones, and school desktop computers to use. Now, whenever I surf the internet, I use uBlock Origin on “kill mode” (extreme filtering mode), Ghostery, Pop-up Blocker, and a variety of anti-mining software, all extensions on Google Chrome. I only visit art websites such as DeviantArt, Twitter, etc., plus Reddit, Spotify, YouTube, and occasionally Snapchat and Instagram, plus lots of Discord.
            <br>The readings are interesting to me because they represent the history of what I use frequently. This idea of world-wide communication is interesting, because even though it seems like everyone was for it for centuries, it wasn’t until medicine progressed to the point where people weren’t constantly dying where people finally had the time to dedicate their efforts towards advancing technology. The wires they used as an early form of telecommunication, I’m curious if any still stand today. They certainly remind me of the telephone and electric poles that stand everywhere today. There has been so much progress in universal communication over the past 3 centuries, it astounds me! When the telegraph finally made way, it was a game changer! I often wonder about the history of the internet and technological communications, and I wonder how they would react if they saw the technology we have today.
